# gh-open

`gh-open` is a terminal utility written in Bash that opens the current GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket page (repository, file, or subdirectory) in your default browser from the command line.

## Features

- ðŸ§  Smart remote detection (tracking â†’ origin â†’ first)
- ðŸ”€ SSH-to-HTTPS URL conversion
- ðŸŒ² Directory vs ðŸ“„ File context-aware link building
- ðŸŒ¿ Branch and commit-aware navigation
- ðŸ§ª Dry-run support (`-n`)
- ðŸ”„ Opens current directory when no path is given, preserving subdirectory context

## Usage

```bash
gh-open [options] [<path>]
```

### Options:

- `-r <remote>` â€” use specific remote (default `origin`)
- `-b <branch>` â€” override branch or commit (default current branch)
- `-n` â€” dry-run (prints the URL only)
- `-v` â€” print version (`v1.0`)
- `-h` â€” show help message

### Examples

```bash
gh-open               # opens web view of current directory
gh-open README.md     # opens specific file
gh-open src/          # opens subdirectory tree view
gh-open -n docs/      # prints URL without opening
gh-open -b develop    # open current directory on 'develop' branch
```

## Installation

Place the `gh-open` script in your PATH, e.g.:

```bash
mv gh-open /usr/local/bin/gh-open
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gh-open
```
